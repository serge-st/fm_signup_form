## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScipt

### What I learned

I mainly started this project to recap my knowledge on frontend engineering, website makrup and styling.

Also I think I leveled up the challenge by throwing TypeSrcipt into the mix.

I'm not sure about the end result, it feels a bit too complex for it's functionality, but I had fun building it.
